Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** file-based Web-platform. There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.

More importantly, gravity is also a fundamental physical principle that describes the forces of attraction between objects. Frankly, the name was chosen as a temporary "codename" for the project, and it just stuck.
